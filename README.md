Hello, thank you for reading!!

As a Intern, I am learning a lot about IT Governance, infrastructure and DevOps routines and tools, one thing that I always try to think and learng is about automation. Can I edit a sheet faster? Can I add data to a sheet and also create an Google calendar event?

I am still learning and loving that discovering experience.
